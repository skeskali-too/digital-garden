# Welcome! 🌱

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[How to Think](_notes/🤔 How to Think.md)</span> to get started on your exploration.
</p>

My name is Cecily Walker ([email](6wjonkplb@relay.firefox.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skeskali/) 🔏, [my personal site](cecily.info)). This is an experiment in personal knowledge management. I was heavily inspired by [Chiara's Digital Garden](https://www.craft.do/s/ByjupAMfZgN6dW) and [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). If you need any help, my [DMs are open on Twitter (@vaillancourtmax)](https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax). 👋
