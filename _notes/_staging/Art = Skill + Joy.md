Art is the joy of creation plus the skill to execute something exactly the way you see it. 

My art practice helps me to visualize in technicolor the emotions I have to keep in check. I present a side of myself that is closer to real, that is less constructed, and isn’t hidden behind a mask. 

The pieces that I don’t post may be, in some kind of way, most pure because I’m not creating them for likes. I create art because I have to create. It’s important to me. And regardless of how others see it, art makes me hold up and take a good look at a part of myself and realize that the only judgment that matters is my own.

That is joyous.
