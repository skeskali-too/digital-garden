My name is Cecily Walker ([email](6wjonkplb@relay.firefox.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skeskali/) üîè, [my personal site](cecily.info)). This is an experiment in personal knowledge management. I was heavily inspired by [Chiara's Digital Garden](https://www.craft.do/s/ByjupAMfZgN6dW) and [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

This is where I polish my thinking through a series of interconnected notes, ideas, thoughts, and resources. This is entirely for my own use, and you will occasionally find ideas that make absolutely **no sense**. That's fine. The nature of gardens is that they always need tending; if you don't do the basic maintenance, weeds will sprout.

## Where to Start?

I‚Äôm hoping that my [[ü§î How to Think]] section will become part of a larger piece to be published later, or maybe, it will just exist as it is, a record of learning in public.
