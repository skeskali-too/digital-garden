# Welcome! 🌱

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[How to Think]] </span> to get started on your exploration.

My name is Cecily Walker ([email][1], [Twitter][2] 🔏, [my personal site][3]). This is an experiment in personal knowledge management. I was heavily inspired by [Chiara's Digital Garden][4] and [Andy's working notes][5].

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch][6]. If you need any help, my [DMs are open on Twitter (@vaillancourtmax)][7]. 👋

This is a test to see which file I'm working with on Netlify.
